Welcome to Portfolio. Here you can find projects, papers, and videos of my current work. 

Gianna Williams is a third- year undergrad student in Computer Science at the American University. Where my interest align with are AI and ethics, computational social science, computational sustainability, human-centered computing, user experience of marginalized groups. She is a Fredick Douglass Distunshed Scholar  at American University where I leverage the knowledge, experience, and network of influential alumni, faculty, and staff to foster a collaborative community in which they prepare for graduate/professional school, nurture their originality, and develop the specialized skills necessary for socially responsible leadership.

```javascript
//const Razorpay = require('razorpay');

//let rzp = Razorpay({
	//key_id: 'KEY_ID',
	//secret: 'name'
//});

// capture request
//rzp.capture(payment_id, cost)
//	.then(function (data) {
//		return 2;
	///})
```
