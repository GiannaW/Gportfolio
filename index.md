Welcome to Portfolio. Here you can find projects, papers, and videos of my current work.

She is a [Frederick Douglass Distinguished Scholars](https://www.american.edu/learning-communities/douglassscholars/current-students.cfm)  at American University where I leverage the knowledge, experience, and network of influential alumni, faculty, and staff to foster a collaborative community in which they prepare for graduate/professional school, nurture their originality, and develop the specialized skills necessary for socially responsible leadership.
