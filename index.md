I am also a Frederick Douglass Distinguished Scholars  at American University where I leverage the knowledge, experience, and network of influential alumni, faculty, and staff to foster a collaborative community in which  I am preparing for graduate/professional school, nurturing originality, and developing the specialized skills necessary for socially responsible leadership.
